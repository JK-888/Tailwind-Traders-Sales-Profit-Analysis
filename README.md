Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- How are **Gross vs. Net** trending over time?
- Which **products/regions/channels** show the largest **Gross–Net deltas**?
- Are **discounts or returns** concentrated in specific segments?

- **Regional Sales**: About **60% of sales revenue comes from a few top-performing regions**, while others lag significantly. Strategic focus on these strong markets could accelerate growth.  
- **Product Categories**: The **top 3 categories generate ~70% of revenue**, but some high-volume items deliver **low margins**. Optimizing product mix is essential to improve profit margins.
